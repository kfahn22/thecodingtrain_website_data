1. In this repo, navigate to the directory of the target challenge.  For example, if the target challenge is number 103 - Fire Effect, click into the "challenges" folder, then click into the "103-fire-effect" folder.
2. Copy the URL in the address bar.  For the example challenge, that would be: https://github.com/skaser85/thecodingtrain_website_data/tree/main/challenges/103-fire-effect
3. Go to https://downgit.github.io/#/home. This website allows for a single resource from a GitHub repo to be downloaded instead of the needing to clone the entire repo.
4. Paste the URL into the text box.
5. Click the "Download" button to download a zip file of the challenge directory to wherever your downloads go.
6. On your machine, navigate to the downloaded zip file and extract its contents. After the files have been extracted, you should have a directory that looks like what's below:
```
   103-fire-effect
    |_ 103-fire-effect
       |- showcase
       |  |- contribution1.json
       |  |- ...
       |  |_  contribution*.json
       |- index.json
       |_ index.jpg
 ```
 7. Copy the inner challenge directory (i.e., the directory that contains the "showcase" directory and the "index.json" and "index.jpg" files) to the "content/videos/challenges" directory of the "thecodingtrain.com" repo on your local machine.
 8. The downloaded zip file and extracted files can be deleted from the directory they were downloaded to.
